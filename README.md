# Stochastic Spike Generator

A computational neuroscience project exploring neural spike train generation and analysis through Poisson processes and refractory period modeling.

## Project Overview

This project investigates how neurons generate action potentials (spikes) over time. It compares theoretical models, such as Poisson processes, with real neural data recorded from an H1 neuron in a fly's visual system. The goal is to understand the statistical structure of neural spiking, including variability, refractoriness, and firing patterns.
